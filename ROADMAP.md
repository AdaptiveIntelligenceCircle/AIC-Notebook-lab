# AIC Roadmap

This roadmap reflects the long-term evolution of the Adaptive Intelligence Circle.

---

## Phase 1 — Foundation (Completed / Stabilizing)

* C++ core structure
* Adaptive context system
* Lua scripting integration
* Basic module architecture
* Preprocessing + protection prototypes
* Baseline introspection engine
* AI Kernel simulation in Jupyter/Colab

---

## Phase 2 — Introspection OS (Current Work)

* Full introspection engine
* Thought-graph representation
* Behavior simulation loop
* Semantic state modeling
* Expand protection (rollback, IDS)
* Modular communication architecture
* `remote_slm_plugin` complete
* Rust plugins added
* AIC Lab repository

---

## Phase 3 — Adaptive OS

* Dynamic plugin loading
* Decentralized node architecture
* P2P synchronization
* Remote behavior auditing
* SLM-powered adaptive decisions
* Multi-language execution sandbox
* Robust message broker

---

## Phase 4 — Distributed Intelligence Layer

* Cross-device adaptive swarm
* Multi-node reasoning
* Trust-based self-protection
* Secure remote training
* Plugin marketplace (semi-open-source)

---

## Phase 5 — Full AIC Ecosystem

* AIC Runtime OS for edge devices
* AIC Kernel for self-adaptive robotics
* AIC Introspective Cloud Platform
* AIC Behavioral Compiler (IBCS integration)
* Multi-agent distributed governance

---

## Philosophy of the Roadmap

AIC does **not** chase hype cycles.
It builds slow, stable, ethical, scalable foundations.
